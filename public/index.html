  <h1 class='hello-world'>My favorite hobby is running and <br> photography (sometimes at the same time).</h1>
  <p> I have always loved to take and collect photographs since I was little; however, I have just <br> begun to take
    running seriously. I have only just begun to compete and participate in races.</p>
  <h2>To become a Runner, you only need one thing:</h2>
  </ul>
  <li>running shoes</li>
  <h2>To become a photographer, you need:</h2>
</ul>
<li>a camera</li>
<li>if you're doing analog, some film!</li>
